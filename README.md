# ai-generated-art-classifier-data

This is a repository made to save data needed for training a Convolutional Neural Net used to distinguish between art generated by Dalle-2 and Midjourney.


The notebook can be viewed in https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BSTikFR86mvwM1bF7rHeQQjBb92DkJwD?usp=sharing.


The images were downloaded from two instagram accounts: @dalle.2_art and @midjourneyartwork. Checkout these pages, really beautiful images.
